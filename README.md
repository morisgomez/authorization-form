# authorization-form
Project via Codecademy's Learn React: Introduction. "A client just called you to say that they love their new website! There’s only one problem: they don’t like how their contact page displays their personal information for all to see. They’ve asked you to hide their website’s contact page behind a password form. In this project, you’ll accomplish this by creating a React component to set up a simple authorization layer."
